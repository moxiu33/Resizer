# How to Resize

1. **Install this APK** while rooted (in case you install this while you have Xreak [2.0.105.0](2.0.105.0) while rooted).

2. **Open the app**, grant it super user access, and click the menu. Then click **Expand Super**.

3. On the first line, type `15` and press **Save Configuration File**.

4. After it finishes, copy the folder named `rannki` to your PC or somewhere safe (you will need to format data and you will lose this folder).

   **DO NOT LOSE THIS FOLDER OR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE NORMAL SYSTEM SIZE.**

5. After you make sure you backup this folder, click the second option to resize.

6. Wait for it to finish, and then once prompted, click **Reboot to Recovery**.

7. After you reboot to recovery, format data and install your ROM.

> **Be careful!** If you have any questions, feel free to ask so you don't mess up.
